**Headline:** The UK Sponsorship list is impossible to search. I fixed it. 🇬🇧🛠️

**Body:**

If you’ve ever tried to search through the official UK Government list of 100,000+ licensed sponsors, you know the pain. 🤯

It’s a massive CSV file. It freezes Excel. It’s hard to search by *both* location and company name—especially on your phone.

Job hunting is already stressful. Checking if a company works with your visa shouldn't be.

So, I built a solution: **UK Sponsor Filter**. 🚀

It turns that clunky CSV into a lightning-fast, searchable tool right in your browser.

✨ **Why use it?**
*   **Smart Filtering:** Instantly filter by **City** and **Company Name** at the same time (e.g., find all "Tech" companies in "London").
*   **Privacy First:** It runs 100% in your browser. The data never leaves your device. 🔒
*   **Zero Lag:** Built with Vanilla JS for pure performance.
*   **Mobile Friendly:** Check sponsors while on the go. 📱

📋 **How it works:**
1.  Download the official "Register of licensed sponsors" CSV from the UK Gov website (link below).
2.  Drag & drop the file into the app.
3.  Filter, search, and export your target list in seconds.
